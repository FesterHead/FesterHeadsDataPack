# FesterHead's Data Pack 
A collection of worldgen, recipes, and other Minecraft modifications.

## The Trees
Tree generation heavily inspired by [Bigger Trees](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bigger-trees) mod.  Worldgen files pulled from jar, adjusted some for size, and included within my data pack.  I especially like the taller oak trees from the plains seed 5467369947628262074 I've been using since 1.19.2 with the Minecolonies mod.

# Why?
Because I can.
