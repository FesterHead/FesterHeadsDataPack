## The trees

Tree generation heavily inspired by [Bigger Trees](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bigger-trees) mod. Worldgen files pulled from jar, adjusted some for size, and included within my data pack. I especially like the taller oak trees from the plains seed [5467369947628262074](https://www.chunkbase.com/apps/seed-map#seed=5467369947628262074&platform=java_1_20&dimension=overworld&x=0&z=0&zoom=0.5) I've been using since 1.19.2 with the Minecolonies mod.
